This project is focused mainly on how javascript can have a dynamic effect on a webpage. Fundementally, this websites purpose is to generate a password that optionally includes having numbers, lower case letters, upper case letters, and/or special characters.

## Usage
The main points that that I followed was :


- Given the user wants a new password, they are prompted to choose whether or not they want:

*Lower case letters

*Upper case letters

*Numbers

*Special characters

** The user must select at least one type of character, if they don't:

    - An alert window will appear asking the user to refresh the browser and to choose at least one type of character.

    - The website will not generate a password when the "Generate Password" button is clicked.

- After they choose the character(s) they want to be included within their password, they are then prompted to choose how many characters they want within their password.

  

** The user must choose between 8-128 characters, otherwise:

    - An alert window will appear asking the user to refresh the browser to choose between 8-128 characters.

    - The website will not generate a password when the "Generate Password" button is clicked.


- Once all the password criteria has been picked, the user can now press the 'Generate Password' button and a password with all the user chosen criteria will appear in the text box above the buttons.

-They can now copy the password that is generated inside the text box to the clipboard simply by pressing the 'Copy to Clipboard' button.

The main reason why it is important for me to know how to apply javascript in a dynamic fashion is to open more possibilities of how a webpage can function outside of a static setting. Through this homework alone:

- I learned how methods are applied to help utilize the functionality of the code, to create an efficient end result on the webpage.
- The use of conditional statements (if/else)
- The use of different kinds of loops.
        * One of the things that I've actually become super glad to learn is how to use if/else statements within loops, I can see that practice becoming useful in other future projects.

I think what's going to make my project stand out is how readable my code is when looking at it; I have left many comments to show anyone looking at the code to help guide them through what is going on in the script.
This assignment got me into the logical mindset of programming; there are so many more concepts that I need to grasp, but I can say I think I am comfortable with these basic fundamentals I've learned in this assignment.
